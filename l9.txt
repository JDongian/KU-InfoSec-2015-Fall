Worm modeling

----

APT: Advanced Persistent Threats
A target attack using various intrusion technologies over an extended period
keywords: target, various, extended period

Threatens: telecommunication, finance, energy, and transport

Virus:
Executes the virus before the original program

Malware obfuscation (compress, encrypt, change code)
1) Code packing compressing exec code to:
  - bypass AV, improve mobility, conceal purpose
  - protect from RE, e.g., PolyPack, Themida
2) Polymorphism: encrypting original code to avoid pattern matching with a different key
3) Metamorphism: change code to equivalent forms by inserting, reordering, or replacing instructions.
(non-cryptographic obfuscation)
